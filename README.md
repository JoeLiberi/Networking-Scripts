# Networking Scripts

A compilation of personal networking scripts that I find useful

## Connect To ASA

Used with "sendcommandtocisco.py" to connect to Cisco ASA devices and run 1 command.

## Connect to IOS

Does that same thing as Connect to ASA but with IOS devices.

## Send Command to Cisco

Uses the IOS and ASA scripts to connect to a device or a list of devices and run 1 command.
